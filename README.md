## Week 1
I learned that:
- Discrete Mathematics is the study of distinct and countable objects.

- "Logic is a branch of philosophy concerned with analyzing the patterns of reasoning by which a conclusion is drawn from a set of premises, 
without reference to meaning or context".

- A proposition is a statement that's EITHER true or false.

## Week 2
I learned that:
- Logical variables hold a Boolean value.

- Compound propositions are combined using logical operators.

- The truth table consists of all combinations of propositional variable values w/ corresponding outputs.

- The conditional statement and its contrapositive have the SAME truth value.

## Week 3
I learned that:
- Logical equivalences serve as alternatives for the truth table.

- Quantifiers express the range of elements.
- The conclusion of a valid argument is true IF AND ONLY IF the premises are TRUE.

- Similarly, an argument is VALID if the truth of all premises implies that the conclusion is TRUE.

## Week 4
I learned about:
- Direct Proof (T --> T = T):

1. Assume that p is TRUE.

2. Show/illustrate that q must also be TRUE.

- Indirect Proof/ Proof by Contraposition (F --> F = T):

1. Assume ¬q is TRUE.

2. Show ¬p is also TRUE.
 
- Vacuous proof

> p --> q = T when p is FALSE.

1. F --> T = T

2. F --> F = T

- Trivial proof

> p--> q = T when q is TRUE.

1. T --> T = T

2. F --> T = T
 
- Proof by Contradiction

1. Assume proposition is FALSE.

2. Use assumption & other facts to reach a contradiction.

## Week 5
I learned about:

- Proof by Equivalence (Biconditional)

> Show p --> q & q --> p are both TRUE.

- Mathematical Induction

1. There should be a BASIS. (Show P(1)/P(0) to be TRUE.
2. Use direct proof.

 a. Assume P(k) to be TRUE.

 b. Show P(k+1) is TRUE.

> If it starts true and it stays true, then it is always true.

## Week 6
I learned about:

- Recursive Definition

> Basis Step: Specify the value of the function  at zero.

> Recursive Step: Give a rule for finding its value at an integer from its values at smaller integers.

- Program Correctness

> Program Verification

1. Show that the correct answer is obtained if the program terminates (partial correctness).

   > initial assertion p --> properties that the input values must have
   
   > final assertion q --> properties that the output of the program should have

2. Show that the program always terminates.

## Week 7
I learned that:
- An empty set is not equal to a set containing an empty set.
- A power set contains all subsets of a set. (no. of subsets= 2^n where n is the number of elements of a set)
- Identities also exist in sets.
 
## Week 8
I learned that:
- If f(a)=b, then b is the image of a.
- There are 3 types of functions.

> One-to-one function (Injective)

 > For every x,y such that (x!=y --> f(x)!=f(y))
 
> Onto Function (Surjective)

 > For every y, there's an x such that (f(x)=y)
 
> Bijective Function

 >If and only if it is BOTH injective & surjective.
 
- An algorithm has 6 important properties.
 1. Input- REQUIRED
 2. Output- REQUIRED
 3. Definiteness- purpose of the program
 4. Correctness- Program should produce a correct output.
 5. Finiteness- It should not run forever.
 6. Generality- applicable to all programs

## Week 9
I learned about different types of algorithms.
- Finding the Minimum/Maximum

> All integers in the set are compared until the minimum/maximum is found.

- Linear Search Algorithm

> All integers in the set are compared until the integer being searched is found.

- Binary Search Algorithm

> The set of integers will be cut into half in each iteration.

- Bubble Sort Algorithm

> Largest will be sorted to the right.

- Insertion Sort Algorithm

> Each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

- Greedy Change Algorithm

> Find the minimum number of coins in a given amount.
