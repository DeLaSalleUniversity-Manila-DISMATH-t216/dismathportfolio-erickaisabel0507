## Week 1
- Discrete Mathematics is the study of distinct and countable objects.

- "Logic is a branch of philosophy concerned with analyzing the patterns of reasoning by which a conclusion is drawn from a set of premises, 
without reference to meaning or context".

- A proposition is a statement that's EITHER true or false.
## Week 2
- Logical variables hold a Boolean value.

- Compound propositions are combined using logical operators.

- The truth table consists of all combinations of propositional variable values w/ corresponding outputs.

- The conditional statement and its contrapositive have the SAME truth value.
## Week 3
- Logical equivalences serve as alternatives for the truth table.

- Quantifiers express the range of elements.
- The conclusion of a valid argument is true IF AND ONLY IF the premises are TRUE.

- Similarly, an argument is VALID if the truth of all premises implies that the conclusion is TRUE.
## Week 4
- Direct Proof (T --> T = T):

1.Assume that p is TRUE.

2.Show/illustrate that q must also be TRUE.

- Indirect Proof/ Proof by Contraposition (F --> F = T):

1.Assume ¬q is TRUE.

2.Show ¬p is also TRUE.
 
- Vacuous proof

> p --> q = T when p is FALSE.

1.F --> T = T

2.F --> F = T

- Trivial proof

> p--> q = T when q is TRUE.

1.T --> T = T

2.F --> T = T
 
- Proof by Contradiction

1.Assume proposition is FALSE.

2.Use assumption & other facts to reach a contradiction.

- Proof by Equivalence (Biconditional)

> Show p --> q & q --> p are both TRUE.
