## Week 1
I learned that:
- Discrete Mathematics is the study of distinct and countable objects.

- "Logic is a branch of philosophy concerned with analyzing the patterns of reasoning by which a conclusion is drawn from a set of premises, 
without reference to meaning or context".

- A proposition is a statement that's EITHER true or false.

## Week 2
I learned that:
- Logical variables hold a Boolean value.

- Compound propositions are combined using logical operators.

- The truth table consists of all combinations of propositional variable values w/ corresponding outputs.

- The conditional statement and its contrapositive have the SAME truth value.

## Week 3
I learned that:
- Logical equivalences serve as alternatives for the truth table.

- Quantifiers express the range of elements.
- The conclusion of a valid argument is true IF AND ONLY IF the premises are TRUE.

- Similarly, an argument is VALID if the truth of all premises implies that the conclusion is TRUE.

## Week 4
I learned about:
- Direct Proof (T --> T = T):

1. Assume that p is TRUE.

2. Show/illustrate that q must also be TRUE.

- Indirect Proof/ Proof by Contraposition (F --> F = T):

1. Assume ¬q is TRUE.

2. Show ¬p is also TRUE.
 
- Vacuous proof

> p --> q = T when p is FALSE.

1. F --> T = T

2. F --> F = T

- Trivial proof

> p--> q = T when q is TRUE.

1. T --> T = T

2. F --> T = T
 
- Proof by Contradiction

1. Assume proposition is FALSE.

2. Use assumption & other facts to reach a contradiction.

## Week 5
I learned about:

- Proof by Equivalence (Biconditional)

> Show p --> q & q --> p are both TRUE.

- Mathematical Induction

1. There should be a BASIS. (Show P(1)/P(0) to be TRUE.
2. Use direct proof.

 a. Assume P(k) to be TRUE.

 b. Show P(k+1) is TRUE.

> If it starts true and it stays true, then it is always true.
